Iâ€™m currently a PhD at the University of Missouri. I study the neurocognitive basis of episodic memory using neuroimaging techniques. I also utilize different machine learning techniques and computational modeling to help understand processes that support episodic retrieval. In addition to research, I spend a lot of time adventuring with friends and playing sports!
